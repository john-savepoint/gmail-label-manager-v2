# Project Brief: Gmail Advanced Label & Workflow Manager (Chrome Extension)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-06-01

## 1. Project Title

Gmail Advanced Label & Workflow Manager

## 2. Problem Statement

Gmail's default interface presents significant usability challenges for users with complex, multi-level label structures and lacks efficient bulk label management capabilities. Specifically:

- **Truncated Label Display:** Label selection dropdowns and lists (e.g., in filter creation, applying labels to emails via buttons or context menus) have a fixed, narrow width (approx. 300px). This truncates the display of nested labels, making it difficult or impossible to identify and select the correct label beyond the second level.
- **Inefficient Sub-Label Searching:** There is no built-in way to easily search for all emails contained within a parent label _and_ all its descendant sub-labels simultaneously without manually constructing a complex search query.
- **Manual & Tedious Label Management:** Adding, removing, and modifying individual label properties (especially colors or hierarchical structure) is a one-by-one process. This is highly time-consuming for users with many labels or those wishing to implement predefined organizational structures (e.g., from AI-generated templates).
- **Lack of Backup/Restore/Portability:** Gmail offers no native functionality to backup, restore, or easily transfer label configurations. This makes it difficult to replicate setups across different Google accounts, recover from accidental mass changes, or share effective label structures.

## 3. Proposed Solution

A Chrome extension that enhances the Gmail interface and integrates with the Google Gmail API to provide advanced label visibility, search, and comprehensive management capabilities. The extension will feature an intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and easy-to-use interface for all its management functions, empowering users to take full control of their Gmail label organization.

## 4. Key Features & Requirements

### 4.1. User Authentication & Authorization

- **Google Sign-In:**
  - The extension will require users to sign in with their Google account to enable features that interact with the Gmail API (all label management features: backup/restore, creation, deletion, bulk editing).
  - A clear, secure, and standard Google Sign-In process will be implemented using OAuth 2.0.
  - Users will be explicitly informed about the permissions (scopes) being requested and why they are necessary for the extension's functionality.

### 4.2. Enhanced Label Visibility & Interaction (UI Modifications)

- **4.2.1. Dynamic Label Dropdown/List Resizing:**
  - **Target Elements:**
    - The label selection dropdown within the "Create filter" view (when choosing "Apply the label:").
    - The label selection dropdown/list that appears when clicking the "Labels" icon/button above the email list.
    - The label selection list that appears when right-clicking an email and selecting "Label as".
  - **Resizing Logic:**
    - The width of these elements must be dynamically adjusted.
    - **Minimum Width:** 800 pixels.
    - **Ideal Width:** Auto-adjust to fit the widest label text string present within the dropdown/list.
  - **Implementation:** The extension must reliably identify these UI elements across various Gmail views and states, using robust selectors and potentially DOM observation.
- **4.2.2. Recursive Sub-Label Search:**
  - **Trigger:** A new context menu option (e.g., "Search all sub-labels (recursive)") when right-clicking on any label displayed in Gmail's left-hand navigation sidebar.
  - **Action:**
    - Upon selection, the extension will identify the selected parent label and all its descendant sub-labels.
    - It will automatically construct and execute a Gmail search query.
    - The search query will use the `OR` operator. Example: \( \text{label:Parent OR label:Parent/ChildA OR label:Parent/ChildA/Grandchild OR label:Parent/ChildB} \)

### 4.3. Comprehensive Label Management (via Gmail API & Dedicated Extension UI)

- **4.3.1. Label Backup & Restore:**
  - **Export:** Allow users to export their entire Gmail label structure to a JSON file. The export must include:
    - Label name
    - Full hierarchical path (e.g., "Work/Projects/Alpha")
    - Color (hex code or Gmail API color object representation)
    - Visibility settings (`labelListVisibility`, `messageListVisibility`)
  - **Import:** Allow users to import a label structure from a JSON file.
    - The extension will parse the JSON and create/update labels in Gmail via the API.
    - Correctly handle the creation of nested labels based on the JSON structure.
    - Provide user options for handling conflicts (e.g., skip if label exists, overwrite existing label properties, merge).
  - **JSON Format:** A well-defined, documented, and versionable JSON schema for label data.
- **4.3.2. Add/Create Labels:**
  - Provide an interface within the extension to define and create new labels.
  - Users must be able to specify label name, parent label (for nesting), color, and visibility settings.
- **4.3.3. Remove Labels:**
  - Provide an interface to select one or more labels for deletion via the API.
  - Include a clear confirmation prompt before deletion, detailing the labels to be removed.

### 4.4. Bulk Label Operations (via Gmail API & Dedicated Extension UI)

- **4.4.1. Bulk Color Editing:**
  - UI to select multiple existing labels from a list.
  - Interface to choose a new color (from Gmail's standard palette and potentially a custom color picker) and apply it to all selected labels simultaneously.
- **4.4.2. Bulk Deletion:**
  - UI to select multiple existing labels from a list.
  - A clear confirmation step detailing all labels selected for deletion before proceeding with the API calls.

### 4.5. User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)

- **Dedicated Management Area:** A dedicated management panel, popup, or options page accessible via the extension icon or a clearly designated area within the Gmail interface.
- **Aesthetics & Usability:** The UI must be "really pretty," modern, intuitive, and exceptionally easy to use, facilitating all management tasks smoothly.
- **Feedback:** Provide clear visual feedback for all operations (e.g., loading states, progress indicators for bulk operations, success/error messages with actionable advice if possible).
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent design language throughout the extension's interface.

## 5. Target Users

- Gmail power users who heavily utilize nested labels (3+ levels deep).
- Users who want to standardize label structures, potentially using AI-generated templates or shared configurations.
- Individuals or teams needing to replicate label setups across multiple Gmail accounts.
- Anyone seeking more efficient, less tedious ways to manage their Gmail labels in bulk.
- Users frustrated by Gmail's current label visibility limitations.

## 6. Technical Considerations & Challenges

- **Gmail DOM Stability:** Gmail's front-end can change. The extension must use resilient selectors and potentially employ Mutation Observers to adapt to UI tweaks for the non-API features.
- **Gmail API Integration:**
  - **Authentication:** Secure OAuth 2.0 flow for user authorization.
  - **API Scopes:** Requesting only necessary permissions (primarily `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels`).
  - **Rate Limiting & Quotas:** Implement robust strategies to handle Gmail API rate limits (e.g., batching requests, exponential backoff for retries).
  - **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling for all API calls, providing clear user feedback and recovery options where possible.
  - **Data Mapping:** Accurately map Gmail API label properties (name, color object, visibility flags like `labelListVisibility`, `messageListVisibility`) to the extension's internal models and the JSON backup format.
- **JSON Schema Definition:** Create a clear, versionable, and well-documented schema for label import/export to ensure compatibility and ease of use (e.g., for AI-generated inputs).
- **UI/UX Design & Development:** Significant effort will be required in designing and implementing an attractive and user-friendly interface. Consideration of a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) for the extension's management UI is recommended.
- **State Management:** Efficiently manage the state of labels within the extension's UI, especially during API interactions and bulk operations.
- **Performance:** DOM manipulations and API calls must be optimized to avoid any noticeable lag or performance degradation in the Gmail experience.
- **Security:** Adhere strictly to Chrome extension security best practices, especially regarding API token storage (use `chrome.identity` appropriately) and handling user data.

## 7. Permissions Required (Manifest V3)

- `"identity"`: For Google OAuth 2.0 authentication to access the Gmail API.
- `"storage"`: To store user settings, preferences, or cached data locally.
- `"host_permissions"`:
  - `"*://mail.google.com/*"`: To read and modify the Gmail interface (for UI enhancements like dropdown resizing and context menus).
- `"permissions"`: (Potentially, depending on specific API usage beyond `chrome.identity` for auth token fetching, though `identity` usually covers it for Google APIs).
- **OAuth Scopes (requested during sign-in):**
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels`: To read, create, update, and delete Gmail labels via the API.

## 8. Success Metrics

- High adoption rate and consistently positive user reviews on the Chrome Web Store.
- Demonstrable time savings for users performing label management tasks, as reported by users or through analytics (if implemented).
- Successful, reliable, and accurate label backup, restore, creation, and bulk modification operations.
- The targeted label dropdowns/lists consistently resize as specified, improving label selection.
- The recursive sub-label search feature accurately identifies all relevant sub-labels and constructs the correct OR-based search query.
- Minimal reported bugs and conflicts with Gmail's native functionality or other popular Gmail extensions.
- User feedback specifically praising the UI/UX for its aesthetic appeal, intuitiveness, and ease of use.

## 9. Future Enhancements (Optional - Post-MVP)

- Advanced rule creation/management for labels based on imported structures or user definitions.
- Functionality to share label structures (JSON files) directly with other users of the extension (e.g., via a simple sharing mechanism).
- Deeper integration with AI services to suggest label structures based on email content analysis (would require additional, more sensitive API scopes like email reading, and careful consideration of privacy).
- Synchronization of label structures across multiple linked Gmail accounts managed by the user.
- More granular control over label properties during import/export.
- A "dry run" mode for import/bulk operations to preview changes before applying them.
