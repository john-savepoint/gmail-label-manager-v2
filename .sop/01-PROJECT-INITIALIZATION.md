# SOP 01: Project Initialization Protocol

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2025-01-31  
**Last Modified:** 2025-01-31  

## Overview

This SOP defines the mandatory procedures for initializing any new software project within the AI-driven development ecosystem. No development work may commence until all initialization requirements are met.

## Prerequisites

- Linear workspace access with project creation permissions
- Git repository initialized
- Claude Code installation and configuration
- Access to required MCP servers (Linear, Context7, etc.)

## 1. Foundation Document Creation

Before ANY code is written or Linear issues are created, the following documents MUST be completed:

### 1.1 Project Requirements Document (PRD)
**Location:** `/requirements/PRD.md`
**Contents:**
- Project overview and objectives
- User personas and use cases
- Functional requirements (what the system must do)
- Business requirements and success metrics
- User stories in Given-When-Then format
- Acceptance criteria for each feature

### 1.2 Project Brief
**Location:** `/requirements/PROJECT-BRIEF.md`
**Contents:**
- Executive summary (2-3 paragraphs)
- Project scope and boundaries
- Key stakeholders and roles
- High-level timeline and milestones
- Budget and resource constraints

### 1.3 Technical Requirements Document
**Location:** `/requirements/TECHNICAL-REQUIREMENTS.md`
**Contents:**
- Performance benchmarks and SLAs
- Security requirements and compliance standards
- Scalability requirements
- Browser/platform compatibility requirements
- Accessibility standards (WCAG compliance level)
- Data requirements and constraints

### 1.4 Technical Implementation Document
**Location:** `/requirements/TECHNICAL-IMPLEMENTATION.md`
**Contents:**
- System architecture overview
- Database schema design
- API design and endpoints
- Third-party integrations
- Security implementation strategy
- Deployment strategy and environments

### 1.5 Tech Stack Document
**Location:** `/requirements/TECH-STACK.md`
**Contents:**
- Frontend framework and libraries
- Backend technologies and frameworks
- Database systems
- Development tools and utilities
- Testing frameworks
- CI/CD tools and platforms
- Monitoring and analytics tools

## 2. Directory Structure Setup

Create the standardized project directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p {codebase,work-trees,docs,requirements}
mkdir -p .sop/templates
mkdir -p .claude/commands
```

### Required Directory Structure:
```
/project-name/
├── /codebase/              # Main repository clone
├── /work-trees/            # Git work trees for isolated development
├── /docs/                  # Project documentation
├── /requirements/          # Foundation documents
├── /.sop/                  # Standard Operating Procedures
├── /.claude/               # Claude Code configuration
│   └── /commands/          # Custom slash commands
└── /scripts/               # Project-specific automation scripts
```

## 3. Linear Project Setup

### 3.1 Create Linear Project
- Create new project in Linear workspace
- Set project description with links to foundation documents
- Configure project labels and priorities
- Set up project milestones if applicable

### 3.2 Issue Template Configuration
Configure issue templates with required fields:
- Title format: "[ID]: [Description]"
- Required labels: priority, component, type
- Required fields: description, acceptance criteria
- Sub-issue template for agent work tracking

## 4. Git Repository Configuration

### 4.1 Initialize Repository Structure
```bash
cd codebase
git init
git checkout -b main  # Use main as primary branch
git checkout -b dev   # Create development branch
```

### 4.2 Configure Git Hooks
- Install and configure Husky for pre-commit hooks
- Set up lint, format, and test validation
- Configure commit message format validation

### 4.3 Create Initial Documentation
- README.md with project overview
- CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
- CHANGELOG.md for version tracking
- .gitignore appropriate for tech stack

## 5. Environment Configuration

### 5.1 Development Environment
- Configure IDE/editor settings
- Install required extensions and plugins
- Set up debugging configurations
- Configure environment variables

### 5.2 Testing Environment
- Set up unit testing framework
- Configure integration testing
- Set up end-to-end testing if required
- Configure test data and fixtures

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline Setup

### 6.1 Build Pipeline
- Configure automated build process
- Set up code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- Configure security scanning
- Set up dependency vulnerability checks

### 6.2 Testing Pipeline
- Automated unit test execution
- Integration test execution
- End-to-end test execution
- Code coverage reporting

### 6.3 Deployment Pipeline
- Configure staging environment deployment
- Set up production deployment (if applicable)
- Configure rollback procedures
- Set up monitoring and alerting

## 7. Agent Configuration

### 7.1 Primary Agent Setup
- Configure Claude Code with project context
- Set up Linear MCP connection
- Configure Git integration
- Test work tree creation workflow

### 7.2 Sub-Agent Preparation
- Create agent instruction templates
- Configure sub-agent triggering hooks
- Set up Linear sub-issue automation
- Test agent communication workflow

## Success Criteria

Project initialization is complete when:
- [ ] All 5 foundation documents are complete and approved
- [ ] Directory structure is properly established
- [ ] Linear project is configured with initial issues
- [ ] Git repository is initialized with proper branching
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is operational
- [ ] All agents can successfully interact with Linear and Git
- [ ] First test work tree can be created successfully

## Quality Gates

No development work may proceed until:
1. Human review and approval of all foundation documents
2. Successful test of the complete workflow with a dummy issue
3. All automated quality checks are passing
4. Agent configuration is verified and tested

## Error Handling

If initialization fails at any step:
1. Document the failure in Linear project notes
2. Identify root cause before proceeding
3. Update this SOP if new failure modes are discovered
4. Ensure all partial work is cleaned up before restart
