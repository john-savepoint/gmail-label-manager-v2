## Purpose

These SOPs ensure:
- Consistent workflow execution across all projects
- Proper task tracking in Linear
- Isolated development environments via Git work trees
- Comprehensive code review and quality assurance
- Automated documentation and orchestration

## Usage

Each SOP document is self-contained and includes:
- Detailed procedures
- Required tools and permissions
- Success criteria
- Error handling protocols
- Agent-specific instructions

## Compliance

All AI agents operating within this ecosystem MUST adhere to these SOPs. Non-compliance may result in workflow failures, task duplication, or compromised project integrity.
